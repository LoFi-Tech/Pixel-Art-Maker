Your users should be able to:

1.Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.<br>
2.Choose a color.<br>
3.Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.<br>

Your primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.
